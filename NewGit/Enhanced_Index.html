            This section explains various Git status indicators:

            - "A" (Added): Status after `git init`.
            - "AM" (Added & Modified): Status after committing and making further changes.
            - "M" (Modified - Red): Status when changes are made after staging.
            - No status shown if no changes are made after commit.
            - "M" (Modified - Green): Status when modifications are staged.

        <p>This is first line</p>
        <p>After git init the status is A</p>
        <p>Just after the above line the status is AM</p>
        <p>Since after added/stage few changes were made, even after committing the status is showing M (red color)</p>
        <p>If you commit after staging and do nothing in between, then check statusâ€”it will show nothing.</p>
        <p>If you modify and then stage, then status will be M (in green color)</p>

            Git Change Recognition:

            Git can track changes made within the code. Even within branches, Git recognizes differences.
            Mixing Hindi and English, this section shows how branches affect commits and visibility.
        -->
        <h4>Does Git recognize the change made in between the code? The answer is Yes.</h4>
